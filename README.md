## What do I do?

I LEARN. First & foremost, I love learning. Whether it's a new programming language, professional practice, or whatever, I enjoy learning new things. Right now, I'm learning full-stack web development. I've worked with a decent amount of languages & tools. 

**Frontend-wise**, I'm an Angular developer who's _more than willing_ to learn another framework. 

When it comes to **backend**, I'm more _framework-agnostic_—I prioritize gaining an  understanding of design patterns and clean code principles, so I can leverage most tools to build robust and scalable applications. With that said, I've touch Java/Spring, Ruby on Rails, & I have plans to learn Laravel & a backend JavaScript framework (TBD).

## Off Topic

- I love video games, & as an extension, I'm also am learning game development. I've built games with [Godot](https://godotengine.org) & I really like building games for the web with [Excalibur.js](https://excaliburjs.com).
  - I have a dream where by day I'm a full-stack developer, & by night I'm building quality games for the web. 
- I really like to workout. In fact, I used to weight 290 lbs & I was able to lose 90 lbs... granted, I've put back about 40 lbs of happy weight since meeting & then marring my wife 😅
- I am also deeply interested in the moden web browser. I believe it to be the most important & facinating run time. These browsers are so powerful & the level of backwards compatability & ubiquity offered by them is paramount
