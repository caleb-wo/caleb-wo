I'm a [Software Engineering](https://www.byui.edu/catalog/#/programs/4kNfm-2oZ?bc=true&bcCurrent=Software%20Engineering&bcGroup=Department%20of%20Computer%20Science%20and%20Engineering&bcItemType=programs) student at [BYU–Idaho](https://www.byui.edu) emphasizing in _full-stack web development_. I'm also pursuing the following certificates: [Full-Stack Web Development](https://www.byui.edu/catalog/#/programs/ryocsyCw9?bc=true&bcCurrent=Full%20Stack%20Web%20Development&bcGroup=Department%20of%20Computer%20Science%20and%20Engineering&bcItemType=programs), [Cloud Computing](https://www.byui.edu/catalog/#/programs/BJa0x8tB2?bc=true&bcCurrent=Cloud%20Computing&bcGroup=Department%20of%20Computer%20Science%20and%20Engineering&bcItemType=programs), [IT Fundamentals](https://www.byui.edu/catalog/#/programs/HJqX-0Hc3?bc=true&bcCurrent=IT%20Fundamentals&bcGroup=Department%20of%20Computer%20Science%20and%20Engineering&bcItemType=programs).

## What do I do? 💻

I LEARN. First & foremost, I love learning. Whether it's a new programming language, professional practice, or whatever, I enjoy learning new things. Right now, I'm learning full-stack web development. I've worked with a decent amount of languages & tools. 

👨‍💻 **_Frontend-wise_**, I'm an Angular developer who's _more than willing_ to learn another framework. 

When it comes to ⚙️ **_backend_**, I claim _framework-agnosticism_—I'm prioritizing gaining an understanding of design patterns and clean code principles, so I can leverage most tools to build successful applications. With that said, I've touched Java/Spring, Ruby/Ruby on Rails, & I'm currently learning NestJS (I want a JavaScript backend option + I _love_ TypeScript).

## A Few Projects 🦾

- 🛡️[Udemy Angular Course](https://www.udemy.com/share/107fKM3@8oOsqdl-5L6cDJHaYQX41CqCJ1qDKAaIXqO2ilYHTVoqAJSa5ip7TUs6dMGYDE-veQ==/) <sup>frontend</sup>
  - **Purpose**: Angular has been the framework I've always been interested in. I held off learning it because I wanted to learn vanilla web dev first. Now, I feel ready to adopt a framework & I've gone with Angular. I've enrolled in this class & it's been a blast. Long story short, I **love** it
  - **Projects**: 📅[Appointment App](https://github.com/caleb-wo/appointment-app), 🏨[Hotel Reservation App](https://github.com/caleb-wo/hotel-app)
- 💍[Wedding Website](https://github.com/caleb-wo/WeddingWebsite) <sup>full-stack</sup>
  - **Purpose**: made for my wedding. It was shared to my family & friends (about 130 invites). It has a gallery & schedule & pointed users our registry & RSVP form
  - **Tooling**: Java, Spring Boot/MVC, Thymeleaf, web languages. Hosted on ![Heroku](https://img.shields.io/badge/Heroku-430098?style=flat-square&logo=heroku&logoColor=white)
- 📲[iOS Weather App](https://github.com/caleb-wo/WeatherApp) <sup>mobile</sup>
  - **Purpose**: When I started learning iOS development & Swift/SwiftUI this was the project I made to solidify my understanding. It is a weather app which fetches weather for the next 3 days (3 days is the API free tier limit)
  - **Tooling**: Xcode, Swift, SwiftUI, SwiftData
- 🦸🏻‍♂️[Hero Hub](https://github.com/roger18gm/hero-hub) <sup>full-stack</sup>
  - **Purpose**: I made this website with a good friend & classmate. It's a hero encyclopedia tool. Here is the site [hero-hub.dev](https://hero-hub-37w.pages.dev) (may not be up at the time you open this). Check it out—try searching "Hulk"
  - **Tooling**: Vanilla Javascript w/ Vite, Java, & Spring backend. Initially hosted on Render via a Docker image

## Off Topic 🏋️‍♂️

- I love video games, & as an extension, I'm also learning game development. I've built games with [Godot](https://godotengine.org) & I really like building games for the web with [Excalibur.js](https://excaliburjs.com)
  - I have a dream where by day I'm a full-stack developer, & by night I'm building quality games for the web
- I really like to workout. In fact, I used to weigh 290 lbs & I was able to lose 90 lbs... granted, I've put back about 40 lbs of happy-weight since meeting & marring my wife 😅
- I am also deeply interested in the moden web browser. I believe it to be the most important & facinating runtime. These browsers are so powerful & the level of backwards compatability & ubiquity offered by them is paramount. My ultimate _long-term goal_ is to become an expert in browser performance and architecture, capable of building applications that push the boundaries of what the web platform can natively achieve
- Lastly I'm a total nerd & love Marvle & DC Comics, Start Wars, & so much more
