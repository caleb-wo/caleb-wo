## Who am I?

<img src="/assets/250529_CalebWolfe_008_NG.jpg" width="300" alt="Portrait of Caleb Wolfe" style="float: right; margin-left: 15px;">

- Passionate about making clean & performant applications both on web & mobile
- Always learning! Sometimes to fault 😅. I've definitely fallen victim to shiney-object-syndrome, but I've found both passion & a home in Angular & iOS Development
- On any given day, you'd find me, programming for a project, learning a new technology, attending BYU–Idaho for classes or work, & spending time with my wonderful wife
- Programming languages & tools: Typescript, web languages, Angular, SwiftUI, Java, Spring Framework, C#, & Bash

## Off Topic

- I love video games, & as an extension, I've also am learning game development. I've built games with [Godot](https://godotengine.org) & I really like building games for the web with [Excalibur.js](https://excaliburjs.com).
  - I have a dream where by day I'm a full-stack developer, & by night I'm building quality games for the web. 
- I really like to workout. In fact, I used to weight 290 lbs & I was able to lose 90 lbs... granted, I've put back about 40 lbs of happy weight since meeting & then marring my wife 😅
- I am also deeply interested in the moden web browser. I believe it to be the most important & facinating run time. These browsers are so powerful & the level of backwards compatability & ubiquity offered by them is paramount
